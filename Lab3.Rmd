## CPB Life History

 \begin{picture}(320,250)
 \put(230,100){\includegraphics[height=2.5cm]{images.jpg}}
 \put(-30,180){\begin{minipage}[t]{1\linewidth} 
 {\begin{itemize}
 \item Complete metamorphisis (Homometabolous) 
 \item Females can lay up to 400 eggs in one season 
 \item 4 larval stages known as instars 
 \item 4th instar larvae burrow into soil where they pupate 
 \item Adults emerge from soil and find host plants
 \end{itemize}}
 \end{minipage}}

## Insecticide Resistance

\begin{itemize}
\item Evolved resistance to over 55 compounds
\item Resistance reported for both conventional and organic compounds
\item Mechanisms for resistance
\end {itemize}
\begin{enumerate} [I]
\item Target site mutations 
\item Increased metabolic excretion rates 
\end{enumerate}


## Stress and Epigenetics

via epigenetic processes like DNA methylation}

## Research Questions

\begin{picture}(320,250)
\put(75,40){\includegraphics[height=3cm]{LightningCPB.jpg}}
 \put(-30,180){\begin{minipage}[t]{1\linewidth} 
 {\begin{itemize}
 \item Is the expression of stress response genes are regulated via DNA methylation?
 \item How does stress affect performance?
 \item Is there a uniform stress response among different stressor?
 \end {itemize}}
